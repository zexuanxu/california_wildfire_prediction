This challenge tries to use machine learning approach to estimate the wildfire in California, and aims to provide answer for those questions:

1. What is the distribution of wildfires in California?
2. Is there any trend in the wildfire frequency and severity (acres burned)?
3. Is there any trend in climate?
4. What are the major factors affecting frequency and severity of wildfires?
5. Can you build models that predicts annual/monthly (1) frequency wildfires, (2) severity of wildfires (by acres burned)?
